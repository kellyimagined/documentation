Pantheon is home to many polylingual and non-English sites, and hosting a multi-language site on Pantheon requires no additional platform configuration.  

For detailed information on how to configure a multilingual Drupal site, see the [Multilingual Guide on Drupal.org](https://drupal.org/documentation/multilingual).

Pantheon doesn’t enforce any particular site layout or architecture for multilingual sites, but the blog entry [Working with multi-regional websites](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/03/working-with-multi-regional-websites.html) from The Google Webmaster Central Blog has some fantastic recommendations.  

It’s possible to specify a site language given a particular domain or path. In order of preference:

1. ccTLDs (country-code top level domain names)
2. Subdomains with gTLDs eg: de.site.com, fr.site.com, etc.
3. Subdirectories with gTLDs eg: site.com/de/, site.com/fr/, etc.

Each of these configurations is possible with Drupal’s built-in language switching.  

You can associate multiple domains with a single site environment. See [adding a domain to a site environment](/docs/domains) for details.
