Our command line interface, Terminus, provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, and more. Use it to script recurring tasks, bulk operations on sites, and integrate with other services.

Terminus is available for <a href="/docs/terminus/install">MacOS/Linux</a> or <a href="/docs/terminus/install#win">Windows</a>.

## Using Terminus

You can use Terminus to perform all of the operations you do on the Dashboard, including:  

- Creating a new site
- Creating and deleting Multidev environments 
- Cloning one environment to another
- Checking for upstream updates
- Pushing code

## Contribute
