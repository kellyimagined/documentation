Terminus is Pantheon's command line interface. It allows you to do everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard. Itâ€™s useful for scripting, automation, and integration with other services and tools.

Terminus is open source! View the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus) to contribute, file issues, and submit feature requests.

## Using Terminus

You can use Terminus to perform most of the operations you do on the Dashboard, including:  
- Creating a new site
- Creating and deleting Multidev environments 
- Cloning one environment to another
- Checking for upstream updates
- Pushing code
